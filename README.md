No.BSS - No Boostrap Stylesheets
==============

A Clean Layout
--------------
Extremely minimalistic, just enough styling to get you going on your next project. Are you sick of the bootstrapped site theme, want to take control of your own style?

Scalable
--------------
Built fully with Compass+SASS, featuring a 960px inspired grid completely rebuilt to take advantage of rem instead of px. Completely scalable UI right down to mobile, with minimal CSS media queries used and absolutely no javascript required!

Extensible
--------------
Intuitive functions and mixins allow for rapid prototyping and extension of existing framework components.

Modern
--------------
Pulls inspiration from past frameworks such as Skeleton, with more modern approaches seen used in Gumby, Foundation and Pure. If you're a fan of the less is more principle, you will likely enjoy No BSS's simplistic approach to styling. Easy to use grid, familiar styling structures, and beautiful defaults. It's there when you need it, and gets right out of the way to leave room for more creativity and less configuration.

What are you waiting for?
--------------
If you like simple, elegant and reusable styling, I know you will love No.BSS. Give it a try, and see what you think.
